# Technical Stop Level Display Fix

## Issue

The bot was incorrectly displaying buffer limit percentages even when the technical analysis returned valid stop levels within buffer limits. This made it appear as if all stop levels were enforced at maximum buffer percentages, which was incorrect.

## Root Cause

In the `handle_stop_loss_request` method, we were:

1. Storing the technical level directly into `stop_loss` variable
2. Passing `stop_loss` to `enforce_buffer_limits` method
3. When enforcement occurred, we replaced the technical level with the buffer-enforced level

This flow led to the technical level being lost during processing when no enforcement was needed, and the display always showing the maximum buffer percentage even when the technical levels were valid and within limits.

## Fix Applied

1. Created a new variable `technical_stop` to preserve the technical analysis level
2. Modified the code to pass `technical_stop` (not `stop_loss`) to `enforce_buffer_limits` 
3. Only updated `stop_loss` and buffer percentage when enforcement was actually needed
4. Added safeguards for proper formatting in debug logs

## Verification

Created `test_technical_level_display.py` to validate:

- For CALL options within buffer limits, technical levels are correctly displayed:
  - Example: $95.00 (5.00% below current price)

- For CALL options exceeding buffer limits, enforced levels are displayed:
  - Example: $95.00 (5.00% below current price), not $93.00 (7.00% below)

- For PUT options within buffer limits, technical levels are correctly displayed:
  - Example: $103.00 (3.00% above current price)

- For PUT options exceeding buffer limits, enforced levels are displayed:
  - Example: $105.00 (5.00% above current price), not $108.00 (8.00% above)

- Different DTE ranges calculate appropriate buffer limits:
  - 0-1 DTE: 1.0% buffer maximum
  - 2 DTE: 2.0% buffer maximum
  - 3-5 DTE: 3.0% buffer maximum
  - 6-60 DTE: 5.0% buffer maximum for CALL, 5.0% for PUT
  - 60+ DTE: 5.0% buffer maximum for CALL, 7.0% for PUT

## Confirmation

All test cases passed, confirming the fix correctly displays:
- Technical levels when they're within buffer limits
- Capped buffer levels only when technical levels exceed buffer limits
