Fix for the handle_stop_loss_request function in discord_bot.py

The issue is that the function is correctly processing the request but not returning the embed object.
Instead, it might be incorrectly sending the embed as part of a message.reply or using other method.

    # 1. Add a 'return embed' at the end of the function
    # 2. Look for instances where the function might be calling message.reply() or message.channel.send()
    #    but not returning the embed object
    
    # This will help modify the function to properly return the embed object, which is expected by
    # various test scripts and the bot's overall messaging flow.
    
    # Sample fix to apply:
    """
    # Make sure the function explicitly returns the embed at the end

    # At the end of handle_stop_loss_request, add:
    return embed
