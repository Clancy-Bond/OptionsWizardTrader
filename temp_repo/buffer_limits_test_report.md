# Buffer Limits Enforcement Fix Test Report

## Background

The stop loss recommendation system enforces maximum buffer limits based on days to expiration (DTE). This ensures stop loss levels stay within reasonable distances from the current price based on option timeframes.

## Issue Summary

The system had several bugs in how it handled and displayed technical levels vs buffer-enforced levels:

1. **Incorrect Level Display**: Sometimes showed the maximum buffer level even when the technical level was within buffer limits
2. **Parsing Errors**: Failed to extract stop levels from nested data structures
3. **Misleading Logs**: Log messages incorrectly labeled levels, making debugging difficult
4. **Type Errors**: Formatting errors due to numpy.float64 vs Python float type differences

## Fixed Buffer Limits Logic

The buffer limits remain unchanged and are enforced correctly now:

| Days to Expiration | Maximum Buffer (CALL) | Maximum Buffer (PUT) |
|------------------:|---------------------:|--------------------:|
| 0-1 DTE | 1.0% | 1.0% |
| 2 DTE | 2.0% | 2.0% |
| 3-5 DTE | 3.0% | 3.0% |
| 6-60 DTE | 5.0% | 5.0% |
| 60+ DTE | 5.0% | 7.0% |

## Test Results

We ran detailed tests with various scenarios:

### CALL Options

| Test Case | Technical Level | Current Price | Buffer % | Max Allowed % | Enforced? | Final Display |
|-----------|---------------:|-------------:|---------:|-------------:|:---------:|--------------|
| Within limits | $217.02 | $221.86 | 2.18% | 5.00% | No | $217.02 (2.2% below current) |
| Exceeds limits | $195.20 | $221.86 | 12.02% | 5.00% | Yes | $210.77 (5.0% below current) |

### PUT Options

| Test Case | Technical Level | Current Price | Buffer % | Max Allowed % | Enforced? | Final Display |
|-----------|---------------:|-------------:|---------:|-------------:|:---------:|--------------|
| Within limits | $216.50 | $221.86 | 2.42% | 5.00% | No | $216.50 (2.4% below current) |
| Exceeds limits | $255.30 | $221.86 | 15.07% | 5.00% | Yes | $232.95 (5.0% above current) |

## Nested Structure Handling

The fix now properly extracts the stop loss level from all possible locations:

1. Direct top-level `level` key
2. Nested inside `swing` dictionary: `stop_loss_data["swing"]["level"]`
3. Nested inside `primary` dictionary: `stop_loss_data["primary"]["level"]`

## Enhanced Debugging Information

Added detailed logging for easier debugging:

```
Technical level buffer is 12.02%, max allowed is 5.00%
Enforcing buffer: Adjusting stop loss from $195.20 to $210.77 to respect 5.0% buffer limit
```

## Final Verification Checklist

- ✓ Shows technical level when within buffer limits
- ✓ Enforces buffer limits when technical level is too far from current price
- ✓ Correctly handles nested data structures
- ✓ Displays correct percentage in all cases
- ✓ Preserves original technical levels throughout processing
- ✓ Type conversion guards prevent formatting errors
