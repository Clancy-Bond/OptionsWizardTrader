I need you to add logic to my options stop-loss recommendation bot specifically for short-term trades (2DTE or less), combining two technical stop-loss strategies: wick-based and VWAP-based stops. The bot should operate conversationally and respond with whichever method gives the tighter (closer to entry) stop.

Here‚Äôs what I want built:

### üîÅ Combined Stop-Loss Logic (2DTE or Less Only)

1. **Wick-Based Stop**
   - Identify the most recent candle (or optionally last 2‚Äì3 candles).
   - For long trades, find the lowest wick; for short trades, the highest wick.
   - Apply a small buffer to account for noise (e.g., `+/- 0.10` or `0.05 * ATR`).
   - Calculate the stop-loss level based on this.

2. **VWAP-Based Stop**
   - Retrieve current VWAP value.
   - For long trades: the stop-loss is triggered if a full candle closes **below** VWAP.
   - For short trades: triggered on a close **above** VWAP.
   - Use the VWAP value itself as the reference stop level for comparison.

3. **Compare the Two Stops**
   - Calculate the dollar distance between each stop and the entry price.
   - Whichever stop is **tighter** (closer to entry) should be used in the final recommendation.

### üì§ Output Format

The bot should respond conversationally with a stop-loss recommendation **based on the tighter of the two methods**, and include both values with an explanation like:

> ‚ÄúBased on current price action, the recommended stop-loss is **$X.XX** using the [Wick-Based/VWAP-Based] method, as it offers a tighter risk level.  
> For comparison, the alternative method calculated a stop at **$Y.YY**.‚Äù

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- This logic should only apply when the user is dealing with **scalp trades or 2DTE (or less)**.
- The bot should compute both stop levels in the background, compare them, and return the one with the smaller risk distance.
- The output should remain conversational and user-friendly.
- Make sure VWAP and candle data are pulled from the correct timeframe (e.g., 5-minute or 15-minute).
- Add comments in the code to make the logic easily extensible.

Let me know once this is implemented or if you need test data to simulate the wick and VWAP conditions.
