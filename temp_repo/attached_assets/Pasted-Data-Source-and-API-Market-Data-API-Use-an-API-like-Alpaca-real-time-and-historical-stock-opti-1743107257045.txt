Data Source and API:

Market Data API: Use an API like:

Alpaca (real-time and historical stock/option data)

Interactive Brokers API (IBKR for options-specific details)

TD Ameritrade API (solid for options chains and real-time prices)

Candle Data:

Request 5-min and 15-min candles.

Include volume, high, low, and close data.

Use bid/ask spread for accurate premium capture.

📏 2. Core Logic:

🎯 Breakout/Breakdown Invalidation Stop-Loss Logic (#3)

Entry Trigger:

Detect a breakout/breakdown based on high/low breach of consolidation range or VWAP breakout.

Volume spike ≥ 1.5x the average of the last 10 candles.

Stop-Loss Calculation:

python
CopyEdit
if trade_direction == 'long':
    entry_price = breakout_candle['close']
    stop_loss = breakout_candle['low'] - (0.1 * atr)  # 10% buffer below low
elif trade_direction == 'short':
    entry_price = breakdown_candle['close']
    stop_loss = breakout_candle['high'] + (0.1 * atr)  # 10% buffer above high
Validation: Ensure breakout is confirmed by high volume.

📈 Engulfing/Reversal Candle Invalidation Logic (#4)

Entry Trigger:

Detect an engulfing pattern (bullish or bearish) with volume 1.5x above 10-period moving average.

Confirm reversal after candle close.

Stop-Loss Calculation:

python
CopyEdit
if trade_direction == 'long':
    entry_price = engulfing_candle['close']
    stop_loss = engulfing_candle['low'] - (0.05 * atr)  # Slight buffer for premium fluctuations
elif trade_direction == 'short':
    entry_price = engulfing_candle['close']
    stop_loss = engulfing_candle['high'] + (0.05 * atr)
Validation: Ensure pattern forms at key support/resistance zones.

⚠️ 3. Risk/Reward and Spread Adjustment

🔄 Check Minimum 2:1 Risk-to-Reward Ratio:

python
CopyEdit
target_price = entry_price + (2 * (entry_price - stop_loss)) if trade_direction == 'long' else entry_price - (2 * (stop_loss - entry_price))
💹 Option Premium Adjustment for Stop-Loss:

Consider bid/ask spread in stop-loss:

python
CopyEdit
adjusted_stop_loss = stop_loss - spread_buffer
spread_buffer could be dynamically set based on option liquidity.

🕹️ 4. Live Execution and Monitoring

📡 API Execution:

Use API to place options orders with stop-losses.

Track open positions, and monitor price changes dynamically.

Exit immediately on invalidation with stop-loss triggers.

📊 5. Additional Enhancements:

✅ ATR-based buffer for fine-tuned stop-loss.

📏 Use VWAP and EMA for breakout confirmations.

📉 Implement fail-safe timeout to avoid theta decay losses in scalps.

🔍 Integrate volume and bid/ask spread checks before entry.

🧠 Sample Pseudocode:

python
CopyEdit
# Import API and libraries
import alpaca_trade_api as alpaca
import numpy as np

# Get 5-min candle data
candle_data = api.get_barset(symbol, '5Min', limit=20)
breakout_candle = candle_data[-1]

# Define stop-loss based on breakout candle
if trade_direction == 'long':
    entry_price = breakout_candle.close
    stop_loss = breakout_candle.low - (0.1 * atr)

# Place order with stop-loss
api.submit_order(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=contract_size,
    side='buy',
    type='limit',
    time_in_force='gtc',
    stop_loss={'stop_price': stop_loss}
)
🚨 Pro Tip:

Use ATR and volume filters dynamically to validate breakout and engulfing setups.

Add a logic check for bid/ask spread before placing orders.
