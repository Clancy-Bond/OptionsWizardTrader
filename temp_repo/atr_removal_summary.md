# ATR Buffer Removal Summary

## Overview
The ATR (Average True Range) buffers have been completely removed from the stop-loss calculation system. This change transitions the system from volatility-based calculations to using exact technical levels with percentage-based maximum limits.

## Changes Made
1. Modified `scale_atr_for_dte` function in `enhanced_atr_stop_loss.py` to return a near-zero value (0.0001) instead of using ATR-based buffer calculations
2. Updated `get_wick_based_stop` function in `combined_scalp_stop_loss.py` to use zero buffer for both CALL and PUT options
3. Updated all ATR-based stop calculations in `technical_analysis.py` to use near-zero buffers:
   - Replaced `atr_buffer = atr * atr_multiple` with `atr_buffer = 0.0001` in various locations
   - Updated `stop_loss = current_price ± (atr_multiple * atr)` to `stop_loss = current_price ± (0.0001)`
   - Ensured ATR buffers were removed for both CALL and PUT options

## Percentage-Based Buffer Limits
Instead of variable ATR-based buffers that fluctuate with market volatility, the system now uses fixed percentage-based maximum limits that vary based on Days to Expiration (DTE):

### CALL Options:
- 1.0% for 0-1 DTE 
- 2.0% for 2 DTE
- 3.0% for 3-5 DTE
- 5.0% for 6-60 DTE
- 5.0% for 60+ DTE

### PUT Options:
- 1.0% for 0-1 DTE
- 2.0% for 2 DTE  
- 3.0% for 3-5 DTE
- 5.0% for 6-60 DTE
- 7.0% for 60+ DTE

## Technical Stop Calculation Process
1. Find support levels below current price (for calls) or resistance levels above current price (for puts)
2. Apply the appropriate DTE-based buffer limit (percentage)
3. Use technical level for stop-loss unless it exceeds the maximum buffer limit
4. If technical level exceeds maximum buffer, fall back to percentage-based limit

## Backup and Restoration
- Created backups of all modified files in the `before_atr_removal_backup` directory
- Updated `restore_from_backup.py` script with documentation about the changes
- The backup script can be used to revert all changes if needed

## Testing
The Discord bot was successfully restarted and is running without errors after the ATR buffer removal.
