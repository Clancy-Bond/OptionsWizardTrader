# Technical Support Level Display Fix

## Issue Summary
The Discord bot was not correctly displaying the actual technical support level percentages in the stop loss recommendations. Instead, it was showing the maximum buffer percentage based on DTE (Days to Expiration) regardless of whether a valid technical support/resistance level was found within the buffer limits.

## Fix Implementation
The fix ensures that when technical support levels are found within the buffer limits, those actual technical level percentages are displayed in the recommendation rather than the maximum buffer percentage.

### Key Changes
1. Modified `enforce_buffer_limits` method to return additional information:
   ```python
   # Return a tuple with (adjusted_stop_loss, max_buffer_percentage, enforced)
   # where enforced is a boolean indicating if the limit was enforced
   return stop_loss, max_buffer_percentage, False  # Not enforced
   ```

2. Updated the calling code to use this information to decide whether to show the actual technical level or the enforced maximum buffer:
   ```python
   # Returns (stop_loss, max_buffer_percentage, enforced)
   stop_loss, max_buffer, buffer_enforced = self.enforce_buffer_limits(stop_loss, current_price, option_type, days_to_expiration)
   
   # Only calculate if the buffer wasn't enforced - we want to show the actual technical level
   # when it's within buffer limits, not the maximum buffer
   if buffer_enforced:
       # Buffer was enforced, use the max_buffer value
       stop_loss_buffer_percentage = max_buffer
   else:
       # Buffer wasn't enforced, calculate the actual buffer from stop_loss and current_price
       if option_type.lower() == 'call':
           # For calls, percentage is how far below current price
           stop_loss_buffer_percentage = abs((current_price - stop_loss) / current_price * 100)
       else:
           # For puts, percentage is how far above current price
           stop_loss_buffer_percentage = abs((stop_loss - current_price) / current_price * 100)
   ```

3. Removed the code that was overriding the actual buffer percentage with fixed DTE-based values:
   ```python
   # We already calculated the actual buffer percentage from the stop_loss level
   # so we don't need to override it with fixed DTE-based values
   ```

4. Added enhanced debugging information:
   ```python
   # Log the buffer percentages for debugging
   print(f"Technical buffer: {stop_loss_buffer_percentage:.2f}%, Max buffer: {max_buffer:.1f}%, Buffer enforced: {buffer_enforced}")
   ```

## Test Results
Tests were conducted with various stocks, option types, and DTEs to verify that the technical support level percentages are correctly displayed:

1. **TSLA 24-day CALL**:
   - Technical support level: $217.02 (2.18% below current price)
   - Maximum buffer limit: 5.0%
   - Result: ✓ Using and displaying technical level (2.18%) since it's within buffer limits
   - Buffer enforced: False

2. **SPY 5-day PUT**:
   - Technical resistance level: $567.42 (14.29% above current price)
   - Maximum buffer limit: 3.0%
   - Result: ✓ Using maximum buffer (3.00%) since technical level exceeds limit
   - Buffer enforced: True

## Verification
A test script `test_technical_stop_display_fix.py` was created to verify the fix. The script confirmed that:
- When technical support levels are found within buffer limits, those actual percentages are displayed
- When technical levels exceed buffer limits, the maximum buffer percentage is used
- Buffer limits still vary by DTE: 1.0% for 0-1 DTE, 2.0% for 2 DTE, 3.0% for 3-5 DTE, etc.

## Conclusion
The fix ensures that the Discord bot now correctly displays the actual technical support level percentages when they are found within the buffer limits. This provides users with more accurate information about the technical basis for stop loss recommendations.

When technical levels are available within the maximum buffer threshold, users will see the actual technical level with its precise buffer percentage. When technical levels are too far away (exceeding the maximum allowed buffer), users will see the enforced maximum buffer stop loss level.
