"""
Fix for the technical analysis buffer logic in the stop loss calculation.

This script fixes a critical bug in the get_swing_stop_loss function where the code
was prioritizing maximum buffer percentages over actual technical support/resistance levels.

Before this fix:
- It would find valid support levels (like $217.02 for TSLA, 2.18% away)
- Then it would ignore that level and use a flat 5% buffer (like $210.77)
- The description would falsely claim it was "based on technical support"

After this fix:
- It will use valid technical levels when available, even if they're closer than the max buffer
- It will only apply the buffer limit when a technical level exceeds that percentage
- The recommendation text will accurately describe what's being used
